## üîó Deployment Tutorial
Note: Overall deployment difficulty is high with a significant time investment. Deploying this plugin requires installing Mirai and mirai-api-http. The main challenge lies in connecting Mirai with QQ.

### Basic Deployment
1. Ensure the server meets the installation requirements
2. Make sure Mirai and mirai-api-http plugin are installed (if you need to use QQ verification)
3. Download the plugin and place it in the `plugins` folder
4. Start and then stop the server to generate the configuration file
5. Edit the `plugins/WLUself01/config.yml` configuration file, ensuring the WebSocket port matches the port used by mirai-api-http
6. Restart the server to complete the installation

### Mirai Configuration Notes
The plugin connects to the Mirai bot framework via WebSocket. For detailed configuration of connecting Mirai to QQ, please refer to the official Mirai documentation and online tutorials.

## üìà Future Plans

- Enhance customization of email content
- Improve Mirai verification functionality
- Enhance error handling mechanisms
- Add optional whitelist web application templates
